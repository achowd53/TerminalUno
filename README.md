# uno-attempt
- My implementation of the game UNO made using C++ 
- Played normally on terminal/Command Line by compiling src/terminal.cpp and running terminal.exe
  - Current terminal.exe included in root directory
  - Must be run in terminal that can use ANSI escape codes or it might look very weird
- Current plans for moving forward:
  - Create a GUI for the game using a C++ web framework
  - Use WebSockets in order to make the game playable with multiple players
