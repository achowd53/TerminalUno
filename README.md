# uno-attempt
- My implementation of the game UNO made using C++ 
- Played normally on terminal/Command Line by compiling src/deck.cpp and running deck.exe
- Current plans for moving forward:
  - Complete rewrite to make code cleaner and more expandable and reusable
  - Create a Terminal-based game with one Player, 3 CPUs
  - Create a GUI for the game using a C++ web framework
  - Use WebSockets in order to make the game playable with multiple players
