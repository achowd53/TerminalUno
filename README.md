# uno-attempt
- My implementation of the game UNO made using C++ 
- Played normally on terminal/Command Line by compiling src/terminal.cpp and running terminal.exe
  - Current terminal.exe included in root directory
- Current plans for moving forward:
  - Create a better decision process for CPU moves
